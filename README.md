# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a programming challenge series designed to test and improve problem-solving skills in fun and creative ways! ðŸš€

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event during December where daily coding puzzles are released from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle has two parts, and solving them earns you stars. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to sharpen your coding skills, explore new programming languages, or just have some festive fun!
